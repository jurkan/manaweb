1. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

To install the account manager just upload it to a webserver running php5.x


2. CONFIGURATION NOTES

There are several config files that have to be prepared for your specific
environment. You can find all config files under ./system/application/config
In general you have to configure the following settings in the mentioned 
files:

    config.php:
        * set the "base_url" to the url of your installation.
        * define the desired "log_threshold" to your needs
        
    database.php:
        * configure all settings about your database like hostname, username
          tmwweb usualy uses the sqlite file generated by tmwserv, so set
          the path to this datafile
          
    email.php:
        * configure your email provider e.g. smtp or sendmail and define
          name of the sender and mailaddress of the server
          
    menu.php:
        * here you can define static links that should be shown everytime
          in the navigation menu on the right side.
          
    tmw_config:
        * here you find all tmw specific configurations. Its worth a look!
        
        
3. TROUBLESHOOTING

After uploading and configuring tmwweb it might happen that every site you 
call is only white and blank. Lets set loglevel in config.php at 4 and after
refreshing your site in the browser have a look at the logfiles under
./system/logs
If there is no file to watch (except index.html), you should check the 
directory permissions of the logs directory. The webserver needs write
access to this directory so chmod 777 ./system/logs
