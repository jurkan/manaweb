1. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS

You will need a web server running PHP 5.1 or later, with pdo_sqlite. 
On FreeBSD you will need to install ports databases/php5-pdo_sqlite and 
security/pecl-hash along with lang/php5. 


=============================================================================

2. CONFIGURATION NOTES

There are several config files that have to be prepared for your specific
environment. You can find all config files under ./system/application/config
In general you have to configure the following settings in the mentioned 
files:

    config.php:
        * set the "base_url" to the url of your installation.
        * define the desired "log_threshold" to your needs
        
    database.php:
        * configure all settings about your database like hostname, username
          tmwweb usualy uses the sqlite file generated by tmwserv, so set
          the path to this datafile
          
    email.php:
        * configure your email provider e.g. smtp or sendmail and define
          name of the sender and mailaddress of the server
          
    menu.php:
        * here you can define static links that should be shown everytime
          in the navigation menu on the right side.
          
    tmw_config:
        * here you find all tmw specific configurations. Its worth a look!
        
After proper configuration of all files you have to ensure that the webserver 
has write access to the ./system/logs and ./data directory. 

    chmod 777 ./system/logs
    chmod 777 ./data
    
Tmwweb tries to store cached data read from other modules like tmwserv in the
data directory for faster access. Therefore you should allow the webserver to 
create files there. The logs directory is used for logging as you can think.

            
=============================================================================

3. TROUBLESHOOTING

After uploading and configuring tmwweb it might happen that every site you 
call is only white and blank. Lets set loglevel in config.php to 4 and after
refreshing your site in the browser have a look at the logfiles under
./system/logs
If there is no file except index.html please recheck your directory 
permissions. Again, the webserver needs write permissions to ./system/logs


=============================================================================

4. TRANSLATIONS

tmwweb has simple multilanguage support integrated. During login into your
account you can choose one of the currently translated languages. If your 
native language is not available yet, feel free to support the dev team and 
translate tmwweb.
To start with a new language there are two simple steps to do:
   a.) copy the directoy ./system/application/language/english as it is the 
       shipped language with tmwweb and should contain all necessary strings. 
       Also you have to copy ./system/language/english to your new language.
       This directory contains string comming from CodeIgniter, the used 
       php framework. 
       Ensure not to copy the hidden directory .svn if you checked
       out from subversion. Each php file ending with *_lang.php needs to be
       translated.
       
       $lang['character'] = '<put your translation here>';
        
       Ensure to double quote '' inside of your strings if necessary.
       
   b.) At least you have to add your new language to the config file
       tmwweb/system/application/conf/tmw_conf.php
       Just add your language to the array $_tmw_languages like shown below.
       The parameter 'dir' has to be the name of your added directory, maybe
       'german'. 'name' is the displayed string during login. This should be
       the native name of the language, like 'deutsch'.
       Don't forget a comma to separate language arrays.
       
       $_tmw_languages = array( 
          array('dir'=>'english', 'name'=>'english'),
          array('dir'=>'german', 'name'=>'deutsch')
       );
