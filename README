I`m not sure about handling binary files in .diff so i've added them to this
release.
The two gifs have to be added under images, the updated db file under data.
The test folder can be removed from branch, it's no longer needed.
Additionally in the current branch you can delete all log files from the log
directory. I think they shouldn be part of a distribution.
