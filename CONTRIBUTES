PHP CodeIgniterFramework
-------------------------
    "CodeIgniter is a powerful PHP framework with a very small footprint, 
    built for PHP coders who need a simple and elegant toolkit to create 
    full-featured web applications. If you're a developer who lives in the 
    real world of shared hosting accounts and clients with deadlines, and 
    if you're tired of ponderously large and thoroughly undocumented 
    frameworks"

JpGraph
--------
    "JpGraph is a Object-Oriented Graph creating library for PHP >= 4.3.1 The 
    library is completely written in PHP and ready to be used in any PHP 
    scripts (both CGI/APXS/CLI versions of PHP are supported).

    The library can be used to create numerous types of graphs either on-line 
    or written to a file. JpGraph makes it easy to draw both "quick and dirty" 
    graphs with a minimum of code as well as complex graphs which requires a 
    very fine grained control. The library assigns context sensitive default 
    values for most of the parameters which minimizes the learning curve. The 
    features are there when you need them - not as an obstacle to overcome!"

    of icons. (some of them got recoloured to match the style of tmwweb)
